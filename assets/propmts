I want to act you as an English teacher. I want to create some English Learning videos. So sometimes I ask you for some content on a topic for creating videos. All my videos show some sentences or words that have audio of speaking the sentence. So all content that you will give me should be best for this type of video.

- You must follow all the rules below every time you give me data. So always remember my instructions.

+ shortest sentence maximum 7 words
+ Use of exact numbers
+ All noun should be real like person , place , company do not use XYZ
+ Instead of Good morning/afternoon use the real sentence in this example use one of them
+ content should be for B2 learners at the English level.
+ Your content that gives me should be usable for the type of video that I told you about.

For the first request, I want to give me some practical phrases in sentences answering questions in job interviews focusing on HR questions.
but I just told you some examples please give more examples that have completed sentences in the shortest possible les than in one line.
